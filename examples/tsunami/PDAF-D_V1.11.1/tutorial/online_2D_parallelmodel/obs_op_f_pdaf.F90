! !ROUTINE: obs_op_f_pdaf --- Implementation of observation operator
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE obs_op_f_pdaf(step, dim_p, dim_obs_f, state_p, m_state_f)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! User-supplied routine for PDAF.
! Used in the filters: LSEIK/LETKF/LESTKF
!
! The routine is called in PDAF\_X\_update
! before the loop over all local analysis domains
! is entered.  The routine has to perform the 
! operation of the observation operator acting on 
! a state vector.  The full vector of all 
! observations required for the localized analysis
! on the PE-local domain has to be initialized.
! This is usually data on the PE-local domain plus 
! some region surrounding the PE-local domain. 
! This data is gathered by MPI operations. The 
! gathering has to be done here, since in the loop 
! through all local analysis domains, no global
! MPI operations can be performed, because the 
! number of local analysis domains can vary from 
! PE to PE.
!
! Implementation for the 2D online example
! with parallelization.
